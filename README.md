# Hi, I'm Paavni Singh 👋  
🎓 Computer Science Undergraduate | 🤖 Machine Learning | 🧠 Multimodal AI | 🏥 AI for Healthcare  

I’m a third-year Computer Science undergraduate passionate about building **intelligent, reliable, and human-centered AI systems**.  
My work focuses on **machine learning, multimodal AI, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, especially for applications in **healthcare, scientific research, and decision-support systems**.

---

## 🔬 What I Work On  

- **Multimodal RAG Systems** (Video, Text, Documents)  
- **Medical Image Analysis** (U-Net, Autoencoders, Segmentation & Denoising)  
- **Large Language Models** (Fine-tuning, LoRA, Agents, RAG)  
- **AI for Healthcare & Policy Analysis**  
- **End-to-End AI Systems** (Model → API → Web/App)

## 🚀 Featured Projects  

### 🧠 Video-RAG MCP Agent  
A multimodal AI agent that lets users query videos using natural language.  
Built using **FastMCP + Groq + RAG**, it retrieves relevant video segments and transcripts before generating grounded answers.

### 🏥 Medical Image Denoising & Segmentation  
- **U-Net** for mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy  
- **Autoencoder-based denoising** for dental X-ray images  
- Achieved **high pixel accuracy and PSNR** for clinically relevant restoration  

### 📜 Government Policy Analysis using RAG  
An AI agent that analyzes government policy documents to generate **evidence-based summaries and effectiveness insights** using **retrieval-augmented generation**.

### 🧠 Mental Health AI System  
A mood-tracking and personalized content recommender using **RoBERTa, Longformer, and GoEmotions**, built to analyze long journal entries and emotional trends.
